Image Block
=====

Firefox add-on to toggle image loading, from a toolbar button.

Based on the Image Block add-on by Hemant Vats http://hemantvats.com/?p=12 (LGPL)

Changes:
- Change the button parent to BrowserToolbarPalette so that it can now be moved, like a regular toolbar button.

Todo:
- Needs new icon :)
- Research how to set max FF version in rdf?
